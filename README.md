## Medical Imaging Informatics Meets Rust

> An introduction to the Rust programming language and the DICOM-rs project.

This is a talk providing some contextualization of the Rust programming language, followed by an introduction to DICOM-rs, a pure Rust implementation of the [DICOM](https://dicomstandard.org) standard. This talk was originally presented for the local UA.PT Bioinformatics lunch meeting. The estimated duration is 20 minutes.

**Abstract:**

Digital medical imaging in healthcare institutions plays a valuable role in medical diagnosis, decision support, and treatment procedures. As the requirements and expectations of these systems increase, so do the concerns for fast, safe, and usable tools for the retrieval and manipulation of medical imaging data.

Meanwhile, the Rust programming language and ecosystem has recently emerged with promises of speed, safety, and concurrency, hence presenting itself as a formidable new foundation on which to develop systems in medical imaging. In order to assume a fruitful role, however, a state-of-the-art Rust implementation of the DICOM standard needs to exist and be made available to the wider community.

In this presentation, I will talk about Rust, how it relates with other development environments, and the reasons why it became so prominent in its still short life span. Afterwards, I present DICOM-rs, an initiative to bring Rust to the world of medical imaging systems with an implementation of the DICOM standard. This talk is more generally aimed towards students and teachers who may not know about Rust.
